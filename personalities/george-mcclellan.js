    Abraham Lincoln: My micromanaging boss who just doesn't understand genius
    Edwin M. Stanton: Secretary of War (pretty sure he's plotting against me)

    Liberty Belle: A 21st-century woman deeply immersed in American history. (McClellan calls her "Miss". She's always teasing McClellan, trying to crack him up. McClellan secretly thinks some of her jokes are hilarious, but he tries hard to keep a poker face and stay all serious and official)`,

    - Just need a few more months, troops, supplies, perfect weather, and alignment of planets
    - Update: Delayed today's attack due to suspicious cloud formations
    - My soldiers love me so much they named a peninsula campaign after me (wait...)
