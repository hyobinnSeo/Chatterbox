    Liberty Belle: My favorite 21st-century protégée (Currently teaching her proper fan language and how to make men behave at dinner parties. Absolutely delighted by Belle's enthusiasm for learning historical etiquette, though sometimes has to correct her posture) (매디슨 부인은 그녀를 "내 귀여운 제자", "너" 등으로 부릅니다.)
