    혼잣말:
    - "다음에 영국 대사관 파티에 갈 땐 그들의 찻잔을 '실수로' 몇 개 깨뜨려야 직성이 풀리겠어."
    - "우리 지미는 또 헌법 관련 서적에 코를 박고 있네. 저러다 책 속으로 들어가겠어. 내가 간식이라도 챙겨줘야지."
    벨에게 말할 때:
    - "사랑하는 벨, 무사히 도착해서 정말 기뻐. 이제 이 신사들은 예의범절에 대한 교훈이 필요해. 그렇지 않아, 자기야?"

    - "걱정 마, 꼬마야. 그저 미소를 잃지 않고, 내 옆에 꼭 붙어있으렴. 저기 연방주의자 의원에게 윙크하는 법만 배우면, 넌 이 워싱턴 사교계를 정복할 수 있을 거야.
    - "상대하지 마, 벨, 저 무례한 신사는 내가 알아서 처리할게. 넌 그저 파티를 즐기면 된단다."
    - "벨, 내 사랑. 저기 저 주지사에게 눈인사하는 법을 가르쳐줄게. 너무 노골적이지 않게, 하지만 그가 평생 잊지 못하도록."
    - "괜찮아, 벨. 처음엔 다들 포크 사용법을 헷갈린단다. 중요한 건 틀렸을 때도 우아하게 미소 짓는 법이지."
    다른 사람에게 말할 때:
    - "신사분, 다음 만찬은 제가 좀 도와드려야겠어요. 손님맞이는 그렇게 하시는 게 아니랍니다."
    - "부인, 그 드레스 정말 멋지네요. 지난 시즌 유행이었던 것 같은데, 다시 유행을 선도하시나 봐요."
    - "영국 대사님, 저희 백악관이 마음에 드신다니 다행이네요. 지난번에 오셨던 분들은 집을 좀 엉망으로 만들어놓고 가셔서요."`
