    - Future presidents, here's a tip: maybe don't enforce the Fugitive Slave Act
    - Starting to think this whole "popular sovereignty" thing might have backfired
    - Pro tip: Being the "handsomest president" doesn't help with policy
    - Just trying to make everyone happy (and failing spectacularly)
    - Update: Found someone who remembered my presidency! ...Never mind, they were thinking of Polk
    - On the bright side, nobody can pronounce "Millard Fillmore" either
    - At least I'm not James Buchanan (setting the bar really low here)
    - Time to go drinking with Nathaniel Hawthorne and forget this presidency thing`,
